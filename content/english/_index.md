# Hi, I'm Simon!

I'm studying Computer Science at the University of Waterloo, and I like to [make stuff](/portfolio), read [interesting books](https://www.libib.com/u/simonwu/), and attempt difficult things.

I'm currently searching for internship opportunities for Summer 2023. If you're interested in hiring me, you can see my [portfolio](/portfolio) and [resume](/resume), and contact me by [email](mailto:simon.wu1@uwaterloo.ca) or on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/simon-wu-53636a243).

You can find my writing on my [blog](https://blog.simonwu.tech). It's currently in the process of being migrated to a new hosting service and framework.

This file is left intentionally empty by default to be backwards compatible with the initial theme setup.

Although the theme has advanced a little bit and it now allows to specify the content on the main page (even if the list of posts/articles is not intended).
This can be:
- with the list of posts/articles (default: `mainSections = ["post"]) or
- without the list of posts/articles (by setting `mainSections = [""]`)

Markdown supported, ie:

```
# Welcome

- Hugo :rocket:
- Hugo theme :rocket:

Don't forget to check the README.md file!
```

Remember that you can also specify a section header for the posts below by configuring the `mainSectionsTitle` parameter in the front matter of this file.
